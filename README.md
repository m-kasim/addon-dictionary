## Dictionary

### Description:
'Dictionary' is a World of Warcraft custom interface addon which helps players learn various graduate (GRE) level English words while playing ingame.
This addon is ideal for those would like expand their vocabulary which is needed for various university level entry exams.
Studies show that the brain is able to learn more effectively when it is in "aroused state", such as while playing games.

### Client version:
World of Warcraft, 1.12.1

### Usage:
Type either of the commands ingame to get a random word from the database displayed in your ingame main chat screen:

`/dictionary`

`/gre`

`/gg`

`/xx`



Each word is provided with a detailed description of its meaning in English, together with an example sentence illustrating its sample usage.
All words are carefully handpicked by me from various graduate level dictionaries such as **Barrons** (https://barronstestprep.com/gre), **Kaplan** (https://www.kaptest.com), **Magoosh** (https://magoosh.com) and others.

Currently, the addon provides the meaning of the word in Bulgarian, but you can also deduce its meaning in any language by reading the long semantic description. Semantic descriptions are fetched from the **Cambridge American English Dictionary**. (https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us).

### How to install:
Place the folder "Dictionary" inside your **`World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\`** directory.
Provided that your game folder is named **`World of Warcraft`** he full path should look like this:
**`World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\Dictionary`**
